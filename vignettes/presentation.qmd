## Introduction

-   Nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$ ) - Reference for Pollution @jo2021
-   Time-Series Approaches and Physical Models @tsai2018

## The Approach

-   Time + Space

-   ConvLSTM

    ![](fig/convlstm.png)

## What else?

-   Multivariate model: include weather related variables

-   Analyse the spatial patterns in responses

-   Do forecasts present the same spatio structure as the data before?

-   Do they present heteroscedasticity throughout their surface?

-   Is there a trend in future forecast in terms of space and time?

## Objectives

-   Use of a ConvLSTM to forecast $NO_2$ with the aid of weather covariables
-   Comparison: ConvLSTM with and without weather covariables

#### Research Questions

-   To what extent can one make use of a ConvLSTM to forecast daily $NO_2$ levels with S5P Imagery and weather related covariables?
-   How does a ConvLSTM using S5P and weather data perform compared to the same model without weather covariables?

## Performance

-   Weather:

    -   RAM

    -   \[350, 350, 6, 1 91, 40\]

    -   Reduced Window and Batches

-   No-weather:

    -   \[350, 6, 1, 91, 40\]

## On-Going Conclusions & Further Steps

-   Further work on weather model mainly, Although it is clearly more complex to handle

-   Further data wrangling : smooth out data

-   R package

-   First R torch ConvLSTM applied to real world scenario
